You have n

(T, D)

complete the n tasks before it's deadline or report if impossible.

valid	<=>   T_i + T_i-1 + ... + T_1 <= D_i 	for every 1 <= i <= n;

if i < j then:
T_i + T_i-1 + ... + T_1 < T_j + t_j-1 + ... + t_i + ... + t_1

Then D_i <= D_j is good

sort for Deadline and tie-break with order of input.

check that order is valid

Improve the order

Try to swap pairs with index from the original input i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n in this order to the left as long as the order is still valid.
